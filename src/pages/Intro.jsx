      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) are
        blockchain-powered systems where everyday people deploy real-world
        hardware to support infrastructure â€” like wireless networks, mapping,
        computing, or storage.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        This means *you* can participate in real-world networks, earn tokens,
        and contribute to decentralized services by setting up devices at home,
        in your car, or in your neighborhood.
